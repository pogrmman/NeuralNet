There are several neural net architetures that work well for this dataset.

Around 65% - 69% test accuracy has been gotten with a deep, thin neural net of
4-6 hidden ReLU or tanh layers on top of one softmax layer. The hidden layers have
between 6 and 10 units.

Around 60% - 65% has been gotten with a broad, shallow network of one hidden layer
with between 30 and 200 units.
